## ✅ Completed Projects

### 📁 Project 01: Iris Dataset Exploration & Visualization

**Goal:**  
Understand relationships and distributions in the Iris dataset.

**Key Actions:**  
- Loaded and described the dataset using Pandas
- Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and outliers using:
  - Scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots

**Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📁 Project 02: Stock Price Prediction (Short-Term)

**Goal:**  
Predict the next day’s closing price for a stock using historical data.

**Dataset:**  
Live data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) via `yfinance`

**Models:**  
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest (compared, showed underfitting)

**Evaluation:**  
RMSE + visual comparison of actual vs predicted prices

**Skills:** Time series forecasting, regression modeling, API data loading

---

### 📁 Project 03: Heart Disease Prediction (Binary Classification)

**Goal:**  
Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using clinical features.

**Dataset:**  
UCI Heart Disease Dataset (via Kaggle)

**Models:**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier

**Highlights:**  
- Cleaned and encoded data
- ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance
- Medical data interpretation and classification workflow

**Skills:** Binary classification, medical AI, model explainability

---

### 📁 Project 04: General Health Query Chatbot (LLM)

**Goal:**  
Build a safe and helpful chatbot to answer general health-related questions.

**Model:**  
OpenAI GPT-3.5 via API

**Key Features:**  
- Prompt engineering: chatbot acts like a friendly medical assistant
- Filtered harmful advice or overly sensitive responses
- Example queries:
  - “What causes a sore throat?”
  - “Is paracetamol safe for children?”

**Skills:** LLM API usage, safety-aware prompt design, chatbot development
